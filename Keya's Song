I need milk, I need milk,
So that I can sleep smooth like silk.
I need to be strong and I need to be pink,
I don't need a coaster with my drink.

Mamma is tired, Pappa is tired,
Gotta let them sleep so that they don't get fired.
I promise to take a little nap,
Oh no! Not now, I just made some crap.
