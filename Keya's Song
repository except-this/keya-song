I need milk, I need milk,
So that I can sleep smooth like silk.
I need to be strong and I need to be pink,
I don't need a coaster with my drink.

Mamma is tired, Pappa is tired,
Gotta let them sleep so that they don't get fired.
I promise to take a little nap,
Oh no! Not now, I just made some crap.

Craps can smell, you can tell,
I make it a point to do them really well.
Mamma always cleans me up, while Pappa gags,
Here comes a projectile in your laps.

You all know, it's a fact,
Burp me...Mamma-Pappa, they really cant.
Nani comes up with ideas every day,
I am gonna always have MY WAY!  

Aaji is here, Nani is here,
That is why I don't have any fear.
Ajoba looks at my pictures everyday,
Nanu always says, "Oh my dear!"
